# Nerpa: NEtwork programming with Relational and Procedural Abstractions

Nerpa is a new programming language for Software Defined Networks (SDN).

For an example of a Nerpa program, check out our [re-implementation of the OVN Open Virtual Network in Nerpa](examples/ovn)

Nerpa is a research prototype. We are working on a production-ready
version. The core part of the new system is the Differential Datalog engine
that can be found [here](https://github.com/ryzhyk/differential-datalog)
